# Codes for the problems on below link

The name of the codes are according to the problem for corresponding chapters.

## Things to remember
<ul>
  
<li> First thing is to download <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/" target="_blank">Qtspim</a>.</li>
  <li> Now you can start running these code. Can you? Give it a try, you will know. </li>
<li> If you skipped the above line, try it. If you skipped than it's you choice if not then, Hurray!! You got some errors. Let's go boy/girl. </li>
<li> Not to worry just do the settings mentioned <a href="https://chortle.ccsu.edu/AssemblyTutorial/Chapter-14/ass14programs.html" target="_blank">here</a>. They will be below the instructions. It's your task to find these settings. You will find it, don't worry. I believe in you.</li>
<li> Now after doing so, you can run these codes. But challenges still remains. Even though you can run these codes, you have to learn to see outputs. It does not show output and errors like other high level languages. Remember these are final codes. I sincerely advice you to try it out yourself before looking into it. It is just another language, You already know how to think (You already know how to add), You just have to talk to the system via its language. Play with the language, make it your friend and it will tell you everything. I know It seems ridiculous but believe me it works.</li>
</ul>
